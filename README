Code for 2017 Bynnybot competition

This is the code leveraged from previous year's code and new development
to control the robot Luminere.

The basic game is 'Hide and Seek'.  There are 20 5gal buckets on each half
of the 56ft field.  In half of these are placeda small stuffed toy rabbit.
The goal is to find the rabbits and place them on the floor on your side of the field.

1 - Autonomous
    a - do nothing (standard)
    b - PID drive straight to distance with gyro compensation
    c - grouped commands to drive straight and try to grab a bucket.
    
2 - Teleop
    a - standard manual drive
    b - PID Velocity control
    
There are also four drive modifiers to affect both auto and teleop:

1 - Deceleration Control (with decel factor on dashboard)
2 - Acceleration Control (with accel factor on dashboard)
3 - Drive Type (Arcade/Tank) - Effects manual driving only
4 - Drive Direction (Forward/Reverse)

There are also 2 control buttons that switch modes as well
A - Climb control (standard)
B - Auto Move forward N inches (set on dashboard, but default will be 48in)
    (this can be used either from a stand-still - V.0 = 0, or from a running start - V.0 = Vstart)

These modes will allow significant testing of the drive train and to understand the best way to control our motion.

Determine max velocity, max acceleration (static friction, wheel limited)
